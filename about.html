          <p>My degree is in Computer Engineer, but I have been exposing myself to different engineering opportunities. I participated in different engineering competition and Hackathons to measure against the brightest engineering minds. Throughout these opportunities, I have gained skills like CAD, analog and digital systems, communication systems, electronic design, programmable microcontroller, Computer Vision, data structure, and worked with languages like Java, Python, Javascript, Assembly, etc. As an engineer and traveler, I designed and rebuilt my family’s cargo van into an RV for backpacking.</p>
