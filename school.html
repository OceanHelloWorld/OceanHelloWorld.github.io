          <h3>SpaceX Hyperloop Competition</a></h3>
          <p>For this competition, student teams from around the country and world came together for a Design Weekend in January 2016 to share their Pod designs. Top teams advanced to the build phase and spent 2016 turning their designs into working Pods. These teams then competed in the first Hyperloop Pod Competition in January 2017, where they raced their Pods on a Hyperloop test track adjacent to SpaceX’s Hawthorne CA headquarters.</p>

          <p>The objective of the project is to create a collapsible mini UAV that would be dropped out of the Predator UAV in a cylindrical pod to ground personnel. This requires the mini UAV withstand transit, and a landing impact equivalent to a 10 foot drop. Once on the ground the UAV must be assembled within 10 minutes. The mini UAV would be capable of withstanding both hot and cold environments, while capturing video of the target area.</p>
